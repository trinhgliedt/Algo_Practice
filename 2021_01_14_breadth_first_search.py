# Consider an undirected graph where each edge weighs 6 units. Each of the nodes is labeled consecutively from 1 to n.

# You will be given a number of queries. For each query, you will be given a list of edges describing an undirected graph. After you create a representation of the graph, you must determine and report the shortest distance to each of the other nodes from a given starting position using the breadth-first search algorithm (BFS). Return an array of distances from the start node in node number order. If a node is unreachable, return  for that node.

# Example
# The following graph is based on the listed inputs:

# image

#  // number of nodes
#  // number of edges

#  // starting node

# All distances are from the start node . Outputs are calculated for distances to nodes  through : . Each edge is  units, and the unreachable node  has the required return distance of .

# Function Description

# Complete the bfs function in the editor below. If a node is unreachable, its distance is .

# bfs has the following parameter(s):

# int n: the number of nodes
# int m: the number of edges
# int edges[m][2]: start and end nodes for edges
# int s: the node to start traversals from
# Returns
# int[n-1]: the distances to nodes in increasing node number order, not including the start node (-1 if a node is not reachable)

# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer , the number of queries. Each of the following  sets of lines has the following format:

# The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the number of nodes and edges in the graph.
# Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers,  and , that describe an edge between nodes  and .
# The last line contains a single integer, , the node number to start from.
# Constraints

# Sample Input

# 2
# 4 2
# 1 2
# 1 3
# 1
# 3 1
# 2 3
# 2
# Sample Output

# 6 6 -1
# -1 6
# Explanation

# We perform the following two queries:

# The given graph can be represented as:
# image
# where our start node, , is node . The shortest distances from  to the other nodes are one edge to node , one edge to node , and an infinite distance to node  (which it is not connected to). We then return an array of distances from node  to nodes , , and  (respectively): .

# The given graph can be represented as:
# image
# where our start node, , is node . There is only one edge here, so node  is unreachable from node  and node  has one edge connecting it to node . We then return an array of distances from node  to nodes , and  (respectively): .

# Note: Recall that the actual length of each edge is , and we return  as the distance to any node that is unreachable from .
