# The selection sort improves on the bubble sort by making only one exchange for every pass
# through the list. In order to do this, a selection sort looks for the largest value as it makes a
# pass and, after completing the pass, places it in the proper location. As with a bubble sort, after
# the first pass, the largest item is in the correct place. After the second pass, the next largest is
# in place. This process continues and requires 𝑛 − 1 passes to sort 𝑛 items, since the final item
# must be in place after the (𝑛 − 1)st pass.
